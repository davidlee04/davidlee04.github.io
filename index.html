            Hello, my name is David Lee and I am a first-year Computer Science major from San Diego, California.
            In high school, a large passion of mine was teaching kids at the local coding school I first attended how to code.
            Now that I'm in Atlanta, I want to keep contributing to my local community, specifically, through Bits of Good and
            developing useful tools that people can use. In my free time, I like to work out, watch YouTube, fence foil, read,
            and hang out with friends.
        </p>
